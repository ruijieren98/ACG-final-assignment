## Team Structure and Task Assignment

### Team Member 1: 3D Graphics and Rendering Specialist
- **Tasks:**
  1. Design and create the 3D model of the glossy ball.
  2. Implement the shading and reflection effects for a realistic glossy material.
  3. Optimize rendering performance for web environments.

### Team Member 2: Physics and Interaction Developer
- **Tasks:**
  1. Develop the physics simulation for the bouncing ball.
  2. Implement collision detection for interactions between balls.
  3. Synchronize physics simulation across instances.

### Team Member 3: Web Development and User Interface Expert
- **Tasks:**
  1. Set up the web environment using HTML5 and JavaScript.
  2. Implement window resizing and dragging features.
  3. Create a user-friendly interface for application manipulation.

### Team Member 4: Networking and Real-Time Communication Engineer
