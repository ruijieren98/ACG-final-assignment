# Project Proposal: Interactive Bouncing Balls in Web Environments
## Introduction
In the realm of computer graphics and interactive web applications, the fusion of simplicity and interactivity often leads to innovative outcomes. This project aims to design and implement an interactive 3D graphics demonstration where glossy balls bounce in a simulated environment, reflecting their surroundings. The uniqueness of this project lies in the interaction between multiple instances of the application, fostering an engaging user experience. For example, two bouncing balls moving in the space and collide with each other.

## Project Description
The core of this project revolves around a 3D rendered scene featuring a glossy ball. This ball isn't just a static object; it dynamically bounces within the confines of the window, showcasing realistic physics and reflection properties. The reflection on the ball's surface is not merely a visual effect but a genuine representation of the ball’s environment, adding depth and realism to the scene.

The project takes an intriguing turn when a second instance of the application is introduced in a separate web window. Initially, each ball in its respective window behaves independently, unaware of the other's existence. However, when a user drags one window close to the other, the balls become aware of each other's presence. This awareness is not just a visual gimmick but influences the balls' physics, allowing them to interact, collide, and influence each other's movement paths as if they co-exist in the same physical space.

## Objectives
- 3D Rendering and Physics Simulation: Utilizing WebGL and libraries like Three.js for 3D rendering, the project simulates the physical behavior of the balls, including moving physics and collision dynamics. The glossy material and reflective properties will be achieved through advanced shading techniques such as Ray Tracing.
- Web Integration: The application will be developed using HTML5 and JavaScript to ensure compatibility across various web browsers. Features like window resizing and dragging will be implemented to facilitate the interaction between multiple instances.
- Real-time Data Exchange: The communication between two windows will be established using WebSockets or similar technologies, enabling real-time data exchange about each ball's position and movement. This will allow for the dynamic interaction between balls from different windows.
- Collision Detection: When windows are brought together, a collision detection algorithm will activate, allowing the balls to interact physically, influencing each other’s trajectory upon impact.

Conclusion
This project aims to push the boundaries of web-based interactive graphics, combining aesthetic appeal with engaging user interactions. It’s a step towards more dynamic and interconnected web applications, offering a glimpse into the future of web-based graphics and interactivity.
